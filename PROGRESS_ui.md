# PROGRESS — UI track (frontend)

Dated notes, newest at the bottom. One line per shipped item.

- 2026-08-13 — M4.1: Installed MapLibre GL + deck.gl (+ react-map-gl). Rendered the
  Meridia 3D world: extruded zone choropleth (Residents/Jobs/Job-density switcher),
  road network with cordon-crossing links highlighted, and the CBD cordon polygon.
  Tile-free MapLibre base (no API key, offline), deck.gl overlay via MapboxOverlay,
  hover tooltips, legend, and a "Synthetic" provenance stamp. Geometry bundled to
  `frontend/public/city/` from `data/city/` (loader prefers `NEXT_PUBLIC_CITY_BASE_URL`
  if the backend later serves `/city`). `tsc --noEmit` + `next build` clean.
- 2026-08-13 — M4.2: Added switchable deck.gl overlays — Traffic flow, Transit demand,
  Support/opposition. Transit heatmap is derived from the real synthetic OD matrix
  (tagged Synthetic, world input); traffic (corridor-load index from link capacity)
  and support (distance-from-CBD gradient) are clearly stamped Placeholder until
  `/simulate` is live (SPEC §34). Each overlay shows a provenance chip + honesty
  caption + legend. Pure metadata split into overlayMeta.ts to keep the WebGL stack
  out of SSR. OD matrix lazy-loaded (~0.4 MB) only when transit is selected.
  `tsc --noEmit` + `next build` clean.
- 2026-08-13 — M4.3: Added the Time Machine scrubber (draggable slider + clickable
  T0→10y ticks) inside a new TwinWorkspace parent that fetches `GET /baseline` and
  shares the selected-checkpoint state. Scrubbing drives the map's time badge (and
  the dashboard, next item). When the backend is down the map still renders and the
  timeline shows an honest "waiting for backend" state — no invented numbers
  (SPEC §34). `tsc --noEmit` + `next build` clean.
- 2026-08-13 — M4.4: Outcomes dashboard — 5 tiles (Traffic, CO₂, Transit, Equity,
  Support). Traffic/CO₂/Transit read the World-A baseline series at the scrubbed
  checkpoint with an SVG sparkline showing the widening uncertainty band, ± band %,
  provenance chip, and a "vs T0" drift delta (direction-aware colouring). Equity &
  Support have no baseline series → explicit "awaiting /simulate" placeholders;
  "vs baseline" delta reads "simulate a policy" until World B exists (SPEC §34).
  **M4 complete.** `tsc --noEmit` + `next build` clean.
- 2026-08-13 — M5.1: Model Parliament view. Added a shared TwinStore context (compiled
  policy + active simulation) so the compiler publishes the DSL and downstream panels
  consume it. ParliamentPanel convenes `POST /parliament/debate` and renders the motion,
  stance tally, and each persona's argument (headline, speech, points, confidence bar)
  with evidence-citation chips (metric/event + provenance) and the synthesis. Prose is
  labelled Generated, cited figures Simulated (SPEC §34). Typed clients for /simulate,
  /parliament/debate, /parliament/failure-modes + a client-side applyAmendment mirror
  of the backend added to lib/api.ts. Backend contracts matched against source; graceful
  states when it's down. `tsc --noEmit` + `next build` clean.
